# Predictive-Modeling-for Diabetes Risk Assessment
 This project aims to use classification models, correlation analysis, and trend analysis to determine whether an individual is diabetic or non-diabetic and identify any underlying trend factors. 
 
# Models Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Neural Network
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest

# Impact and Value
High accuracy (96% with Random Forest) ensures reliable predictions for clinical use, and  the ability to generalize across diverse patient demographics enhances applicability.
Models can be scaled to analyze larger datasets across multiple regions or healthcare systems.
It provides a foundation for exploring other diseases using similar methodologies and expanding healthcare analytics.
Insights into key predictors like HbA1c levels and BMI allow tailored healthcare plans. Encourages proactive management through lifestyle changes and regular monitoring.
